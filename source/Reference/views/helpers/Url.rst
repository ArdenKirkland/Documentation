.. php:class:: Omeka_View_Helper_Url

    .. php:method:: url(string|array $options = Array, string|null|array $name, array $queryParams = Array, boolean $reset = , boolean $encode = 1)
    
        Generate a URL for use in one of Omeka's view templates.
        
        There are two ways to use this method.  The first way is for backwards compatibility with older versions of Omeka as
        well as ease of use for theme writers.
        
        Here is an example of what URLs are generated by calling the function in different ways. The output from these
        examples assume that Omeka is running on the root of a particular domain, though that is of no importance to how the
        function works.
        
        .. code-block:: php 
        
             echo $this->url('items/browse');
             // outputs "/items/browse"
                   echo $this->url('items/browse', array('tags'=>'foo'));
             // outputs "/items/browse?tags=foo"
                   echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'));
             // outputs "/items/browse"
                   echo $this->url(
                 array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'), 
                 'otherRoute', 
                 array('tags'=>'foo'), 
             );
             // outputs "/miscellaneous?tags=foo"
        
        
        The first example takes a URL string exactly as one would expect it to be. This primarily exists for ease of use by
        theme writers. The second example appends a query string to the URL by passing it as an array. Note that in both
        examples, the first string must be properly URL-encoded in order to work. url('foo bar') would not work because of
        the space.
        
        In the third example, the URL is being built directly from parameters passed to it. For more details on this, please
        see the Zend Framework's documentation.
        
        In the last example, 'otherRoute' is the name of the route being used, as defined either in the routes.ini file or
        via a plugin. For examples of how to add routes via a plugin, please see Omeka's documentation.
        
        :param string|array $options: 
        :param string|null|array $name: Optional If $options is an array, $name should be the route name (string) or null. If $options is a string, $name should be the set of query string parameters (array) or null.
        :param array $queryParams: Optional Set of query string parameters.
        :param boolean $reset: Optional Whether or not to reset the route parameters implied by the current request, e.g. if the current controller is 'items', then 'controller'=>'items' will be inferred when assembling the route.
        :param boolean $encode: 
        :returns: string
